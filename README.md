🎯 Why This Project?
As an aspiring game developer, I wanted a platform where I could one day showcase the games I build — and that’s how PixelPlay Game Store was born.

This project serves as the foundation of my future indie game portfolio, simulating a real-world storefront where players can discover, view, and eventually purchase or download my games. It reflects my passion for both game design and web development, combining clean UI aesthetics with the spirit of gaming.

By building this from scratch using only HTML and CSS, I focused on mastering the fundamentals of structure, layout, and styling — all while imagining how I would present my original games to the world someday.
